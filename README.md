# Final project for the Interactive Graphics Course 
This is the final project for the Interactive Graphics Course held by Professor Marco Schaerf at Sapienza University of Rome in the spring of 2023.

# The Game
The game is an endless runner, in which you keep running while trying to dodge obstacles and pick stars to increase your score.
You can restore the health you lose when you get hit by an obstacle by taking the hearts that spawn randomly during the game.

## DEMO
A demo of the game can be played [here](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-gervasio_interactivegraphics_22-23/).
